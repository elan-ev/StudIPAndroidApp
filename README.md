# Stud.IP Android App
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/elan-ev/StudIPAndroidApp.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/elan-ev/StudIPAndroidApp)

A mobile Stud.IP client application for the Android plattform which utilizes the studip-rest.ip Rest-API Plugin [studip/studip-rest.ip][2]
for communication with a Stud.IP backend.

## Setup
If you want to contribute to this project, feel free to do so. At first you need to fork the repository into your own account. This will change the clone URL listed in Step 1. For more information on contributions, have a look at the [contributing](#Contributing) section below.

1. Clone the repo with ```git clone --recursive https://github.com/elan-ev/StudIPAndroidApp.git```. This ensures that the submodules are initialized as well.

2. Android Studio
  * Under Quick Start click ```Import Project..``` and choose the cloned project root
  * Choose ```Use gradle wrapper (recommended)```
  * Press Ok and let Gradle do the rest
  * If you want to learn more about Gradle and Android Studio, you can find further information [here][9]

3. Server setup
  * The app now expects a static servers String variable in ```de.elanev.studip.android.app.util.ServerData.java```.
  Formatted as followed:
  
  ```json
  {
    "servers": [
      {
        "name": "Installation name",
        "consumer_key": "consumer key generated by the restip plugin",
        "consumer_secret": "consumer secret generated by the restip plugin",
        "base_url": "https://example.com/plugins.php/restipplugin",
        "contact_email": "contact@example.com"
      },
      {
        "name": "Optional second installation",
        "consumer_key": "XXX",
        "consumer_secret": "XXX",
        "base_url": "XXX",
        "contact_email": "XX@XXX.de"
      }
    ]
  }
  ```
  
  * Since the OAuth credentials are stored in a 256-bit AES encrypted database you need to set the PRIVATE_KEY String    constant in ```de.elanev.studip.android.app.util.Config.java``` adequately.
